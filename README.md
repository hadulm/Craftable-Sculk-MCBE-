Craftable Sculk Addon (MCBE)
Addon that adds crafting recipes for all Sculk Blocks for Bedrock Edition. 
Made for players that cannot update their games from 1.18.10 due to RenderDragon implementation.

-Why did i make this addon?
Due to the implementation of the RenderDragon rendering engine, some 64 bit Devices are stuck in version 1.16.100, but are able to install x32 .aapx installers of versions up to 1.18.10.
(Bug report: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-102530 )

In this version Sculk Blocks exist, but are unobtainable due to them not generating naturally (It was implemented literally ONE version after this one, in 1.18.30), and since the Sculk Catalyst does not generate the other Sculk blocks like it does in recent versions, even if you somehow got one, you would only get Sculk Blocks and Veins. 
So, i've decided to make crafting recipes for all Sculk Blocks, since other addons i've looked up either incorporate other things as well, or have weird crafting recipes.
(And, as a bonus, i've made them accesible for Skyblock Players due to the crafting materials ;P)


--IMPORTANT--

In versions before 1.19 you WILL need to enable the "Wild Update" and "Vanilla Experiments" toggles in the world menu for the addon to work.
